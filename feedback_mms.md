# Project Feedback + Evaluation

I am impressed with what you were able to produce, code-wise.  You have a working flashcard game!  Unfortunately, you pretty much ignored all the steps that differentiate a developer from a coder.  For your next project, I hope you will set aside a little time to review the requirements and ensure the basics exist.

## Project Workflow

> Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Did Not Meet Expectations**. No readme?  No information about your process or your difficulties?  I was really hoing to hear about this went for you.

## Technical Requirements

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few week of WDI are represented, and more.

## Code Quality

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Good job. Html is clearly structured. Javascript is extracted into objects and functions, with decent names (usually).

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**.  You got the standard game working.  That's what we expected.  I'm glad you added actual questions & answers.  That simple change made a world of difference.  :)
